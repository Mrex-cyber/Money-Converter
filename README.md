# MoneyConverter

I made this project for a test task in an IT company. I needed to make a Money Converter that is connected to Public API. 
All interfaces and functionality I developed in one day.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
